How to modify the JLink environment to add the VA416xx to Segerâ€™s supported devices:

Modify by adding the tag below to C:/Program Files (x86)/SEGGER/JLink/JLinkDevices.xml or alternately copying the attached JlinkDevices.xml into the JLink directory.
<Device>
    <ChipInfo Vendor="Vorago" Name="VA416xx" WorkRAMAddr="0x20000000" WorkRAMSize="0x00008000" Core="JLINK_CORE_CORTEX_M4" />
<FlashBankInfo Name="Internal FRAM" BaseAddr="0x00000000" MaxSize="0x00040000" Loader="Devices/Vorago/VA416_SPI_FRAM_256KB.FLM" LoaderType="FLASH_ALGO_TYPE_OPEN" AlwaysPresent="1"/>
</Device>

(You might wish to create a copy with the Name changed from VA416xx to VA416XX. It seems there are setups out there looking for each variant)

Create C:/Program Files (x86)/SEGGER/JLink/Devices/Vorago/
Copy file (VA416_SPI_FRAM_256KB.FLM) in Vorago.VA416xx.1.0.3.pack to C:/Program Files (x86)/SEGGER/JLink/Devices/Vorago/

With a licensed Segger product, JFlash.exe is available. For JLink OD, JFlashLite.exe is available. 
These products can be used to program the VA416xx completely within the Segger environment. 
The Ozone debugger and SEGGER Embedded Studio are also available for use from the Segger website.
